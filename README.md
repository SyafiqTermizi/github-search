# Github search

## About the project
Currently, we cannot search for a repo that matches topics that we are interested in.

This project allows users to search for repos based on multiple topics that the user keyed in.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have nodejs and npm installed

### Installation
1. Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/SyafiqTermizi/github-search.git
```

2. Install NPM packages 
```
npm install
```

3. Start dev server
```
npm run dev
```

Congratulations, the project is now running on localhost:5173!
